Use of Artificial Intelligence in Forensic Science

## Summary

The use of AI can be used within the application of forensic science in order to enhance specific techniques and to eliminate the duration of a process and any error that humans may make. For example, when detecting fingerrpitns o a surface, they may not be immediately visible under visible lighting; therfore different wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum can be used such as ultraiolet. This use of AI can be used in order to scan an object for fingerprints, by scanning an object with ultrasound to establish the sistance between the origin point to the objects surface, where any variation in the distance the wave travels could indicate a possibility of a visible fingerprint.


## Background

Within forensic science, technique and processes can be time consuming and cost authorites a lot per year. Therefore with the devlopment of AI this problem can be reduced. This kind of technique can be useful for larger objects that could take a scientist hours to complete, ccould be completed within a matter on minutes. By studying forensics cience at university i can see oppertunities for specific tenchiques to be enhanced by newer technology, with one of these being AI. Although new automated technology has been introduced in forensci science, the notion of this being common is largly rejected over that of it being completed by a human. Though if it was found that AI could help within a larger range of types of forensics, then the idea of newer technology being used could become more common.

To summerise, the main problmes forensic scientists face are:
* Time consuming techniques
* Costly
* Outdated technology being prefered


## How is it used?

This could work by placing an object in a container where when the programme is run a computer scanner would mover around the object in an X,Y,Z plane to scan the entire object. During this scanning untrasound waves will be emitted withing the container and an 3D image could be make of the object by recording the speed of the wave and the time taken for it to reflect and retaun to a detector on the scanner. The difference in the time taken to return to the origin would indicate a difference in the surface of the object and therfore any details would be visible to the user. From this, the model is thenn fed to a programme where it is programmed to deterct any characterisitcs of a fingerprint such as ridges and patterns. Ai can be then used to identify any specific characterists such as the overall patters such as loops, whorls and arches. Then any specific characterists like bifurations, laskes and hooks ect... can be detected from this mark on the object and a mapping of the fingerprint can be processed. Then the AI can compare the detected fingerprint characterists to that found on the National Database, whether it be sections or an entire print. 

Scientists will be needed to oversee the unning of the AI and if any problems arise. They would also be needed to handle the object and then check the mapping of the fingerprtn in order to ensure that it is accurate, and the AI can learn and adapt for further use.
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Challenges

This does not solve how fingerprints would be detected if they needed chemical enhancement to be seen. It is not known whether ultrasonic wavelengths could affect DNA or any other scientific material that would be found on an object from a crime scene.

## What next?

This could move on to detecting latent prints that usally need chemcial enhancement to be visible.
